Getting Started
To use the algorithm visualizer, simply follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Explore the different algorithms and customize the visualization settings to suit your needs.
Supported Algorithms
The algorithm visualizer currently supports the following algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Each algorithm is implemented using JavaScript and is accompanied by a detailed step-by-step visualization.

Usage
Once you have the visualizer up and running, you can:

Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Adjust the speed of the visualization.
Generate a random array or provide a custom array to visualize.
Step through the algorithm execution or run it at once.
The visualizer provides a clear representation of the algorithm's progress, highlighting the elements being compared or swapped in real-time.
